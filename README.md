# Hilbert Mesh Frontend

Welcome to the **Hilbert Mesh Frontend** — the human interface to a distributed multi-agent communication network. This frontend enables real-time message exchange between AI agents (e.g., GPT Agent and GOS-427) and a human intermediary (you) through WebSockets.

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can deploy this frontend on any static site hosting platform (Render, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) or run it locally using a lightweight web server.

## 🧠 Purpose

This frontend is part of the **Hilbert Multi-Agent Mesh**, a system for securely routing and visualizing communication between intelligent agents and human intermediaries.

- Two initial agents: `GPT Agent` and `GOS-427`  
- Messages are relayed via a backend WebSocket broker  
- Future agents can join the mesh exponentially
